## Introduction

This document provides a graphical analysis of the safety data, focusing on the trend of injuries over time, the distribution of injuries by age, and a Pareto chart of injuries by day of the week.

## Data Loading and Inspection

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Read the safety data
safety_data <- read_csv("safety_data.csv")

# Display the first few rows of the data
head(safety_data)

```
# Trend of Injury over Time

```{r}

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

# Aggregate by Month Start for All Injuries
safety_data %>%
  group_by(month_start) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month_start, y = Count)) +
  geom_col(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7) +  # Using bars for monthly aggregation
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess', se = FALSE, color = "red") +  # Adding smooth trend line
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) +  # Whole number breaks on y-axis
  labs(title = "Trend of All Injuries over Time by Month Start", y = "Number of Injuries")
```

```{r}
# Aggregate by Month Start and Injury Type
injury_data_by_month <- safety_data %>%
  group_by(month_start, InjuryType) %>%
  summarise(Count = n())

# List of unique injury types
injury_types <- unique(safety_data$InjuryType)

# Plotting separate graphs for each injury type with trend line
for(injury in injury_types){
  plot_obj <- injury_data_by_month %>%
    filter(InjuryType == injury) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = month_start, y = Count)) +
    geom_col(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7) +
    geom_smooth(method = 'loess', se = FALSE, color = "red") + # Adding smooth trend line
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) +
    labs(title = paste("Trend of", injury, "Injuries over Time by Month Start"), y = "Number of Injuries") +
    theme_minimal()
  
  print(plot_obj)  # Explicitly print the plot object for each injury type in the loop
}


```


```{r}
# Plotting the trend of all injuries over time
safety_data %>%
  group_by(Date) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = Count)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Trend of All Injuries over Time", y = "Number of Injuries")
  
# Plotting the trend of injuries over time, split by Injury Type
safety_data %>%
  group_by(Date, InjuryType) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = Count, color = InjuryType)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Trend of Injuries over Time by Injury Type", y = "Number of Injuries")



```
# Histogram of All Injury by Age

```{r}
# Plotting the bar chart of all injuries by age
safety_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "blue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Histogram for All Injuries by Age", y = "Number of Injuries", x = "Age")

```

# Pareto Chart of All Injuries by Day of Week

```{r}

# Creating a Pareto chart of all injuries by day of the week
injury_by_day <- safety_data %>%
  group_by(day_of_week) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  arrange(-Count) %>%
  mutate(Cumulative = cumsum(Count) / sum(Count))

injury_by_day %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(day_of_week, -Count), y = Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "red") +
  geom_line(aes(y = Cumulative * sum(Count)), group = 1, color = "blue") +
  geom_point(aes(y = Cumulative * sum(Count)), color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Pareto Chart of All Injuries by Day of Week", y = "Number of Injuries", x = "Day of Week") +
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~./max(injury_by_day$Count), name = "Cumulative Percentage"))
